\chapter{ALONSO Manual}
ALONSO is a C++ deterministic CPT code that runs fully coupled multi-specie ion and neutron transport problems. All of the CPT transport operators discussed in this work are provided in both one-dimensional planar and spherical geometries. ALONSO has two dependencies of note: 1) SALLY which provides the classes necessary for CPT, and 2) LANDO which generates all of the multigroup charged particle data.

As a general overview, ALONSO is a steady-state, one-dimensional planar or spherical transport code that allows for the coupled transport of six different particle species: proton, neutron, deuteron, triton, helion, and $\alpha$-particle. Figure \ref{fig:ALONSO_code_structure} shows the general structure of ALONSO. Using a user supplied input file, ALONSO constructs the geometry, data, and sources. These are then passsed to a transport solver which solves the coupled system either as one large solve or as a system of outer-inner solves. The solution is then passed to the output function which produces an output file in JSON format.

In the remainder of this chapter we first discuss the format of the input files and the various options available in ALONSO. Next the three different C++ classes that ALONSO uses to construct a problem are discussed. The last section discusses the output function and the format of the output file.
