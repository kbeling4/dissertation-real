\section{Outline}
Section 2 of this proposal describes the interaction physics of charged particles in detail and introduces the CPT equation. Section 3 provides the details of the FP and the BFP collision operators including a discussion of the properties and limitations of each. In Section 4, the numerical discretization of the various operators encountered in CPT are introduced using the discrete ordinates and discontinuous Galerkin methods. Section 5 describes the current state of the charged particle data, including: the current analytical form of the Coulomb differential cross section, and how the multigroup data required by the numerical methods is computed. Finally, in Section 6 the proposed research required to meet the research goal of this work is presented.
