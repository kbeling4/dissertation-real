\chapter{Charged Particle Transport Equation}
The purpose of this chapter is to define the transport problem that will serve as the basis for the approximations developed in later chapters. This is done by first introducing the general kinetic Boltzmann transport equation, and modifying it to model the particular case for charged particles. The result is a coupled system of equations that describes not only the transport of the energetic ions, but also the recoil and nuclear reaction network of the ions.
