\section{Ion Elastic Scattering}
Elastic scattering collisions with the background ions consists of two types of collisions: 1) Coulomb collisions, and 2) nuclear elastic scattering (NES) collisions. Coulomb collisions are characterized by long-range collisions that are peaked about zero angular deflection and energy loss. NES collisions on the other hand are short range collisions that result in large angular deflection and energy loss collisions. At lower energies $(< 1 \mev)$ Coulomb collision dominate the slowing down process; however, at higher energies $(> 1 \mev)$ NES effects become more important as cause energy losses in single collisions to become more significant \cite{Hale-1983}. In addition, because the light ions experience both long-range (Coulomb) and short-range (NES) elastic scattering collisions with background ions, an interference cross section is needed to accurately describe the quantum mechanical interference between the two different types of elastic scattering.

In the remainder of this section the relevant physics and differential cross sections for Coulomb, NES, and interference collisions are discussed. Additionally, because the mathematical models introduced previously require Fokker-Planck moments of the elastic scattering differential cross section a discussion is provided.
