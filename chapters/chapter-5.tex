\chapter{Charged Particle Multigroup Data}
In this chapter the methods used to compute the multigroup charged particle data required by the charged particle transport equation are discussed. Note, only collisions that result in two bodies are considered in this work meaning that multi-body collisions are not considered. In the remainder of this chapter we first present the two body particle kinematics for both elastic and nuclear reaction collisions. Next, the algorithms used to compute the multigroup charged particle data are introduced, and finally the BFP decomposition methods are introduced.
