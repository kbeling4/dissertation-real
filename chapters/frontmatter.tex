    I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Martin Sheen, for his support
    and some great action movies.  I would also like to thank my dog, Spot,
    who only ate my homework two or three times.  I have several other people
    I would like to thank, as well.\footnote{To my brother and sister, who
    are really cool.}

\begin{abstract}
    The theory of relativity is a real ``toughie'' to prove, but with the
    help of my family and my great grandpa Al, this paper presents the
    proof in its entirety.  Most of the math is correct, and the
    part about ``warp speed'' and ``parallel universe'' sounds very high-tech.
